# Add a Header

Here is my first paragraph of text

and here is the second paragraph
with at least one *bold* and one **italic** word
and then there is _underscore_ and ~~strike through~~

* one
* two
* three

And then
1. a
2. b
3. c


Here's a table

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

Here is some Ruby code
```ruby
	# test to see if file parameter is a local file
	# if not ... it is assumed to be a json string
	if File.exist?(file)
		# read file
		my_file = File.open(file, 'r')
		fileObj = my_file.read
		my_file.close
	else
		fileObj = file
	end
```
